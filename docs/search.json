Accepted at Review of Economics and Statistics\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nWe study how various zoning regulations combine to affect housing supply, prices, and rents of single- and multifamily homes using novel lot-level zoning data from Greater Boston and a cross-sectional boundary discontinuity design at regulation boundaries. Looser density restrictions, alone or with other less restrictive regulations, are most effective in increasing supply and reducing per-housing-unit rents and prices. We theoretically and empirically show that restrictive zoning regulations shift housing stock towards larger units, increasing prices per housing unit. Counterfactuals imply that a recent Massachusetts law increasing building density near transit can reduce long-run rents and prices, particularly in suburbs.\n\n\n Manuscript    Online appendix    SSRN    Repo    Replication package    Historic Zoning Maps web tool\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2022. Evictions in New England and the Impact of Public Policy. Regional Brief 22-2. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nTo stave off a flood of evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was the feared outcome when millions of renting households were suddenly unemployed, Congress and many states implemented policies that included eviction moratoriums and federally funded rental-assistance programs. These programs succeeded in keeping millions of renters housed and driving eviction rates down in the early months of the pandemic. The number of evictions filed in New England declined 56 percent in 2020 and 39 percent in 2021 compared with the average number of evictions filed annually from 2017 through 2019—the pre-pandemic period. Recently, new fears have arisen that many renters remain financially unstable from the pandemic and that a dramatic increase in the number of evictions will follow the end of rental-assistance programs. Based on data from three New England states, it is not clear that these fears will be realized. Evictions rose modestly following the end of these programs in Massachusetts and Rhode Island but stayed below pre-pandemic levels. While in Connecticut, evictions spiked sharply once programs ended and remain slightly above pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nSood, Aradhya, Amrita Kulka and Nicholas Chiumenti. 2022. How to Increase Housing Affordability? Understanding Local Deterrents to Building Multifamily Housing. Working Paper Series 22-10. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nThis paper studies how local land-use regulations and community opposition affect the trade-offs to building single-family, multifamily, and affordable housing and how their effects on rents differ from their effects on house prices. Using lot-level zoning regulations and a boundary discontinuity design at regulation boundaries in Greater Boston, we obtain causal estimates for the effects of zoning regulations on the supply of different types of housing, single-family-house prices, multifamily rents, and households’ willingness to pay for higher density. We find that relaxing density restrictions (minimum lot size and maximum number of dwelling units)—either alone or in combination with relaxing maximum-height restrictions or allowing multifamily housing—is the most fruitful policy reform for increasing the housing supply and reducing multifamily rents and single-family-house prices. However, adopting multifamily zoning or relaxing height regulations alone has little effect on the number of units built or on rents. Moreover, in each land-use relaxation scenario where rents fall, house prices also fall, complicating the political economy of land-use reform. We also find that mature suburbs that are closer to a city center and have a representative town meeting structure of local governance are the most restrictive with respect to adding multi-unit housing. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning policies such as Massachusetts’s Chapter 40B rarely substitute for relaxing zoning regulations, particularly restrictions on building multifamily housing.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nSood, Aradhya and Nicholas Chiumenti. 2022. Local Zoning Laws and the Supply of Multifamily Housing in Greater Boston. Research Report 22-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nHousing affordability is a significant issue in many U.S. metropolitan areas, including Greater Boston. Affordability has always been a major challenge for low-income renters; however, even middle-income families now face considerable affordability hurdles, particularly in metro areas with strong labor markets. Where people live has important implications for their health, schooling, and economic mobility. Researchers and policymakers have devoted attention to the role of land-use practices, such as regulating residential zoning, in creating housing affordability problems, particularly in the context of single-family houses. This paper studies how zoning regulations influence affordability in the context of multifamily housing, focusing on Greater Boston. It finds that reforms such as relaxing housing-density restrictions could lead to meaningful increases in the supply of multifamily housing and reductions in rents.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2021. How the COVID-19 Pandemic Changed Household Migration in New England. Regional Brief 2021-3. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the policies implemented to limit the spread of the virus brought about changes to domestic migration patterns in New England. Overall, the region lost about 50,000 fewer households to permanent out-migration in 2020 compared with 2019, as measured by United States Postal Service change-of-address requests. Every New England state except Massachusetts either lost fewer households or gained households for the first time since at least 2017. However, counties that added households generally saw an increase of less than 1 percent. The characteristics of a community mattered as to whether it gained or lost households. Communities with more than 1,000 people per square mile lost an average of 3 percent of households in 2020, while those with fewer than 1,000 people gained an average of 2 percent. The size of the college-student population in an area did not have a large effect on net migration, despite the move to online schooling for much of 2020. However, the share of seasonal housing in a community did. The number of households in areas with 25 percent to 50 percent seasonal housing stock grew by almost 2 percent through permanent net migration. Temporary net migration also led to positive net migration overall in much of New England in 2020, indicating that many of the new residents may not remain in their communities for the long term.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN    Data\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2021. Rental Affordability and COVID-19 in Rural New England. Regional Brief 2021-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nAlthough a shortage of affordable rental housing is often framed as an urban-area issue, rural communities also suffer from this problem. On average, rural and urban renters spend similar shares of their income on rent and have comparable rates of housing-cost burden. Years of slow income growth and skyrocketing rents, particularly during the 2000–2010 period, have eroded slack in household budgets that may have gone toward other expenses or toward savings. The coronavirus pandemic likely has exacerbated affordability problems by putting many rural residents out of work. The share of jobs lost in rural New England communities has been large, even though these areas have seen far fewer cases of COVID-19 (relative to their population size and overall) compared with the region’s urban areas. This is in contrast with the experience in much of the rest of the country, where, as of January, rural areas nationally had seen far more COVID-19 cases but had lost a smaller share of jobs. Due to the economic conditions in the region’s rural areas, many renters could find it increasingly difficult to afford their housing costs. Even after the pandemic ends and the negative economic impact subsides, rural New England households likely will still face considerable affordability challenges.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2020. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on New England Homeowners and Renters. Regional Brief 2020-2. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nJob losses and likely layoffs related to the COVID-19 pandemic will put many New England residents at risk of not being able to pay their mortgage or rent and needing financial assistance and state-government safeguards to remain in their homes. Economic interventions from Congress, primarily through the federal CARES Act, include direct payments to households and increased unemployment insurance benefits that are expected to provide vital support to many of these households for the next three to four months. Even with these efforts, 2 to 3 percent of New England homeowners and 9 to 13 percent of New England renters may be unable to make their housing payments. Many states have temporarily halted evictions, foreclosures, or both to protect people from losing their homes, at least in the short term. However, once the economy begins to recover, these households will remain responsible for their unpaid rents and mortgages. This report’s findings represent the immediate, three- to four-month impact that the coronavirus outbreak and resulting legislation are likely having on New England households. The ultimate economic consequences of the pandemic, along with the adequacy of economic-policy responses, will be determined largely by how long it takes to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2020. Recent Trends in Residential Segregation in New England. Regional Brief 2020-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nResidential segregation in Boston has drawn considerable attention in recent years, but much less notice has been given to the issue with respect to the rest of New England. This regional brief focuses on residential segregation between all minority groups and non-Hispanic white residents in metro areas throughout the region. New England’s population is predominately non-Hispanic white; however, the region has diversified considerably since 1990, as most of the population growth has occurred among minority groups. Residential segregation by race/ethnicity declined over that same period in nearly every medium-sized and large metro area in New England, though the levels remain modestly higher than the national averages. Contrary to the broader trends, many of New England’s small metro areas saw increases in residential segregation during the 1990–2017 period. While racial and ethnic minorities in the region tend to be clustered in fewer neighborhoods relative to the rest of the United States, they are less isolated from non-Hispanic whites; that is, on average, a minority resident of a New England metro area has a considerably higher share of white neighbors compared with minorities elsewhere in the country.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nZhao, Bo and Chiumenti, Nicholas. 2020. Measuring Disparities in Cost and Spending across Connecticut School Districts. Research Report 2020-2. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nDespite multiple court cases and repeated efforts at reform, there are still significant concerns about the equity and the adequacy in Connecticut’s public K–12 education funding. One vital component of any attempt to reform education finance is a methodologically rigorous evaluation of what it would cost school districts across the state to achieve target performance standards given their student characteristics. This report addresses that need, evaluating the equity and the adequacy of school spending in Connecticut based on education costs. Different from actual school expenditure, a district’s education cost is an estimation based on its cost factors that are outside the direct control of local officials at any given point in time; efficiency levels are held constant across school districts in the estimation. This report finds large disparities in education costs due to differences among school districts in cost factors. It also finds that, despite existing state aid programs, disparities in cost-adjusted spending across the state remain large. Spending in some districts is well below the levels needed to achieve common performance goals. Among the specific findings of this report is that in the last year for which data were analyzed, the average costs of school districts with the lowest socioeconomic status and highest level of student need were 62 percent greater than those of districts with the highest socioeconomic status and the lowest level of student need. When this report holds every district’s efficiency at the statewide average level, it finds that more than half of Connecticut’s public school students attended districts where spending was insufficient to meet the “predicted costs” to achieve the statewide average student test performance level. A direct, negative consequence of spending inadequacy is student underperformance relative to the common student performance target.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2019. The Growing Shortage of Affordable Housing for the Extremely Low Income in Massachusetts. Policy Report 2019-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nThis report identifies ways that the state’s policymakers and housing agencies and providers can more efficiently use limited resources to address the affordable housing needs of extremely low-income households. The first is to prioritize rental assistance in areas of the state where rents are low and the inventory of market-supplied housing is high. Doing so will take advantage of local market conditions that are favorable to rental-assistance subsidies while addressing these areas? high rates of rent burden. Tax-credit and other supply-oriented subsidies can be targeted more heavily to areas with less affordable housing stock overall. Building geographic considerations into program administration can help achieve this tailoring of resources. Second, preserving expiring subsidies in smaller cities and towns will ensure broader access to affordable housing throughout Massachusetts. The state?s increasing need to preserve affordable housing is widely acknowledged and supported. Many of these units are located in major cities and metro areas; however, smaller cities and towns, while accounting for a smaller share of the subsidized housing, are at risk of seeing most or all of their subsidized units expire by 2025.\n\n\n PDF    Appendix    SSRN    Data   [ Online ]\n\nChiumenti, Nicholas. 2018. The Supply of Permanent Supportive Housing in Massachusetts: Comparing Availability to the Chronic Homeless Population. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, New England Public Policy Center. Boston, MA.\n\n\n\nShow Abstract:\n\n\nPermanent supportive housing (PSH) has become an important resource for Massachusetts service providers working to address chronic homelessness in the state. Nationally, and in the Commonwealth, the number of PSH beds available for homeless individuals and families now exceeds the amount of emergency shelter beds and other, non-permanent, housing options. While PSH is acknowledged as an important tool, there has been little research into the inventory level needed to effectively house the state?s current chronic homeless population, and what, if any, local shortages exist. This report uses publicly available inventory and homeless population count data to estimate the number of PSH beds needed to effectively house the chronically homeless individuals and families living in Massachusetts. In addition, this report looks at the Continuum of Care service regions to examine how differences in homeless populations affect local shortages of PSH within the state. The report finds that Massachusetts has made marked progress toward increasing the state?s PSH inventory, with at least one PSH bed available per chronically homeless individual in 2016 and 2017. There remains, however, a statewide shortage in PSH beds for chronically homeless families. The situation may vary considerably across localities, with some areas experiencing PSH shortages while neighboring areas have surpluses. Finally, using incomplete data on planned additions to the PSH inventory shows that less progress has being made at alleviating these two differences in supply. There are still more individual beds than family beds being added, with inventory additions for both types of PSH decreasing, and only a handful of Continuums of Care planning new PSH beds for the coming years.\n\n\n PDF    SSRN\n\nHenry, David K., Sandra D.
