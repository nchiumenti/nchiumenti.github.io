I am an Economist in the Data Analytics Division of U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Rural Development agency, where I've been since 2023. Prior, I was 
a Policy Analyst with the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston.

This site is a work in progress where I hope to showcase past, current, and 
future work. More to come soon!
